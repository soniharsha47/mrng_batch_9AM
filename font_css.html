      A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
      arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern
      digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known
      as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
      tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes
      the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
      needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of
      computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer
      network or computer cluster.
